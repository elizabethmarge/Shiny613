## Question 2

## Nested Lists are used to create lists inside of lists. To clarify, it is a list that occurs as an element from another list, and the other list may be an element of another lists. It is important to note that a nested list should only be placed inside of a list item of a parent list, or it will not work. We often use nested lists when there are matricices, which are a list of each row is itself a list, or when a list of columns itself is a list.
